        <h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
        <p> Incorporating the new language, PHP, into our project, we were tasked to build a website that would display content based on pulling information from a database. Along with that, we could add, edit, delete and search content from that database reacted. The default website would have been a recipe website. While others from the class did what the professor instructed them to do, I had asked for permission to build a therapy website, where I would be pulling therapists out of a database, rather than recipes.  
            <br> 
            <br> 
            After 10 weeks and different stages of the project, I was able to design and code a website that pulled therapist information out from a database using HTML / CSS, JavaScript and PHP.   
        </p>

    <div class="case-study context-and-challenge">
        <h2> CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE </h2>
        <p> Seeing this opportunity to create something that could highlight my passion in therapy and mental health, I designed and coded a website on my own that would share the experience of looking for different types of therapists. Trying to accomplishing different stages of designing and building this project out in a 10-week course, every week was a step further to fleshing this out.  
            <br> 
            <br> 
        <p> As someone who is not tech savvy or who has not developed a developer’s mindset just yet, picking up a language, let alone a coding language, was very difficult to me. I needed many phone calls, zoom rooms, extra-help sessions, and open-labs to somewhat grasp how the logic of it all works. While the syntax was not bad at all and HTML (a language I am familiar with) is incorporated into PHP as well, the logic of pulling data from a database externally from the code was very difficult to understand. Along with that, due to the rigor of Drexel’s quarter system, I did not have much time to review the content from the previous week’s materials before the new material was taught. </p>
            <p class="goals"> GOALS </p>
            <ul class="goals_list"> 
                <li class="goals_list_item"> To find enough therapists to put into the database </li>
                <li class="goals_list_item"> To understand PHP enough to have data pull from a database and show, giving the illusion of static code </li>
                <li class="goals_list_item"> To style the website with the intention of making the user feel calm </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study process-and-insight">
        <h2> PROCESS AND INSIGHT </h2>
        <p> Through different stages, I was able to slowly develop and think out how I wanted my mental-health-focused website to be like. From the start, I knew I wanted to make it calm, with muted greens, pale yellow, white, and black. I wanted it to be simple.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="details">
                <img src="images/process-home.png" alt="pics" class="process-home"> 
                <img src="images/process-therapy-detail.png" alt="pics" class="process-therapy-detail"> 
            </div>
            <p> Building out the header and footer was rather straightforward, and linking those two files on every page was self-explanatory. It was when I needed to understand the logic behind making a table in PHPMyAdmin in the local database and calling the functions to show all of them on my All Therapists page or to just calling one function by ID to show up in the Therapist Detail page. </p>
            <br> 
            <br> 
            <p> Once I figured out how to add the therapist into my database, editing was similar enough and deleting was also a similar process. </p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study solution">
        <h2> SOLUTION </h2>
        <p> For the final stage, I had found all of my therapists and had manually put the information into the table into my local database. I exported it to the production database and things seem to come together. Once all my functionality was done, styling the website was similar to styling a website with HTML.  I had so much fun!   
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> Altogether, these designs, triggers, and code contribute to a delightful and pleasant design that is therapy-focused with genuine intention to make people feel calm while looking through this website of therapists. </P>
        </p>

    <div class="case-study results">
        <h2> RESULTS </h2>
        <p> I found this project to be a success in some way, but also a learning opportunity in another way. Not only did I strengthen my HTML / CSS and JavaScript usage and knowledge, but it also allowed me to create a meaningful website that was centered around something I am passionate in in PHP. Not only did I meet my goals, but I also found alternative solutions to the issues even after trying to stick with my original plan. I would want to make more changes to improve this website for the future and maybe even add in some microinteractions or skills I had learned in other classes. I am excited to have this on my portfolio and would love to receive feedback on how to improve this.  </p>
